<<set $mood to "passionate">>
Pixel: TypeScript is THE language for modern game development! Here's why it's amazing:
Pixel: • It adds types to JavaScript - no more "undefined is not a function"!
Pixel: • The Strata engine gives us superpowers for graphics and game logic! 
Pixel: • It runs directly in the browser - no installation needed!
Pixel: • And the tooling is incredible - autocomplete everywhere!
-> Sounds awesome!

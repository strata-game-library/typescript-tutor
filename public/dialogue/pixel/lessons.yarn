title: ConceptExplanation
---
<<if $concept == "variable">>
    Pixel: Variables are like labeled boxes 📦
    Pixel: You put data in them, and TypeScript knows what type of data it is!
    Pixel: In games, you store player health, score, and position in variables.
<<elseif $concept == "function">>
    Pixel: Functions are like recipes! 🍕
    Pixel: You write the steps once, then call the function whenever you need it.
    Pixel: Super useful for actions that happen multiple times in games!
<<elseif $concept == "interface">>
    Pixel: Interfaces define the shape of objects! 📐
    Pixel: They tell TypeScript exactly what properties an object should have.
    Pixel: Perfect for defining players, enemies, and items!
<<elseif $concept == "class">>
    Pixel: Classes are blueprints for creating objects! 🏗️
    Pixel: They combine data and behavior into reusable templates.
    Pixel: Every game entity can be a class!
<<elseif $concept == "array">>
    Pixel: Arrays hold collections of items! 📋
    Pixel: With TypeScript, you know exactly what type of items are in the array.
    Pixel: Perfect for inventories, enemy lists, and projectiles!
<<else>>
    Pixel: Let me explain {$concept} in a simple way...
<<endif>>
-> Show me in code
    <<showCodeExample($concept)>>
-> Got it!

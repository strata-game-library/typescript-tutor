Pixel: Let me take a look at those TypeScript errors... 🔍
<<if $lastError contains "Property">>
    Pixel: Looks like a property access issue! Make sure the object has that property.
<<elseif $lastError contains "type">>
    Pixel: There's a type mismatch. TypeScript expected one type but got another!
<<elseif $lastError contains "Cannot find">>
    Pixel: You're using something that hasn't been defined yet. Make sure to import or declare it first!
<<elseif $lastError contains "undefined">>
    Pixel: Something might be null or undefined. Try using optional chaining (?.) or null checks!
<<else>>
    Pixel: Let me show you how to debug this step by step.
<<endif>>
-> Show me how to fix it
    <<showErrorFix($lastError)>>
-> Explain TypeScript errors
    Pixel: TypeScript errors are your friend! They catch problems before your game runs.
    Pixel: The error message tells you exactly what's wrong and where!

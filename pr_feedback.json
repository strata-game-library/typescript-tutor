I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request executes a comprehensive transformation of the educational platform, shifting its core technology and learning focus from Python/Pygame to TypeScript and the Strata game engine. This change impacts all user-facing content, from interactive lessons and dialogue to detailed documentation and development guides, ensuring a consistent and modern TypeScript-first game development learning experience.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Complete Rebranding**: The entire educational platform has been rebranded from a Python/Pygame focus to 'Strata TypeScript Tutor', emphasizing TypeScript and the Strata game engine for interactive game development.\n* **Content Overhaul**: All documentation, lesson content, and dialogue have been completely rewritten to align with the new TypeScript and Strata focus, including new game genres like Space Shooter and Dungeon Crawler.\n* **New API Documentation**: Comprehensive API reference documentation has been added for the Strata game engine, detailing core classes, component systems, input handling, audio, and scene management.\n* **Client-Side UI Updates**: Key client-side UI components, including the header, Pixel's menu, presence, and lesson pages, have been updated to reflect the new branding and lesson structure.\n* **Development Workflow Changes**: The contributing guide and installation instructions have been updated to reflect the shift from Python-centric tools (uv, pytest) to Node.js-based tools (pnpm, npm, ESLint, Prettier) for TypeScript development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

The scope and consistency of changes across 27 files is impressive, showing careful attention to rebranding every aspect of the platform.\n\n### ✅ **Strengths**\n\n- **Comprehensive Rebranding**: Consistent transformation across all components, documentation, and dialogue\n- **Educational Structure**: Well-designed lesson progression from basic TypeScript to game development\n- **Content Quality**: Engaging, game-focused learning objectives with practical examples\n- **Documentation**: Thorough updates to all documentation files with clear explanations\n- **UI Consistency**: Proper updates to all user-facing text and branding\n\n### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Requiring Resolution**\n\n1. **Missing Strata Engine**: The core educational content references `@strata/engine` classes that don't exist in the codebase\n2. **Repository URL Mismatch**: Package.json points to wrong repository URL\n3. **Broken Import Paths**: Students will encounter runtime errors with current lesson code\n\n### 📋 **Recommendation**\n\n**Request Changes** - While the rebranding effort is excellent, the missing Strata engine implementation is a critical blocker. The educational content cannot function without either:\n- Implementing the referenced Strata engine classes\n- Providing mock/placeholder implementations for learning\n- Updating examples to use existing libraries\n\nOnce the Strata engine dependency is resolved, this will be an excellent educational platform for TypeScript game development.\n\n---\nYou can now have the agent implement changes and create commits directly on your pull request's source branch. Simply comment with /q followed by your request in natural language to ask the agent to make changes.\n","submittedAt":"2025-12-23T19:11:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"c91aeca91e12d083d703e2d6e621c10ee99578df"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOQpntYM7XHgOn","author":{"login":"gemini-code-assist"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"## Code Review\n\nThis pull request represents a comprehensive and impressive rebranding of the repository, shifting the educational focus from Python/Pygame to TypeScript and the Strata game engine. The changes are extensive, covering documentation, lesson content, dialogue files, and UI components, and the new branding is applied consistently throughout. The new documentation and lesson plans are particularly well-done and provide a solid foundation for the new educational direction. I've identified a couple of minor areas for improvement: an undefined interface in the API documentation and an opportunity for more specific exception handling in the Sphinx configuration. Overall, this is an excellent and well-executed overhaul.","submittedAt":"2025-12-23T19:12:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"c91aeca91e12d083d703e2d6e621c10ee99578df"}}]}
